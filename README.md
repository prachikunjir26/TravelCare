Problem Statement: When flights get delayed, rescheduled, or canceled, generally airlines announce it and offer one of the below alternatives:
Offer stay at a hotel
Offer cab coupons
Book a flight with the same airline
This process takes usually after you meet with airline agents at the airport desks. Let's say there are so many people on the flight and after landing, everyone rushes to the desk to talk with an agent. Suppose there is an immediate flight from another airline then to avoid waiting in line or if you have any other requirements other than those 3 offered by the airline, then you can use this app. 

Solution:
This solution is integrated with the airline's existing app or as a separate business. When a flight gets delayed, rescheduled, or canceled then the app will give you an alert and reschedule options. To avoid standing in long lines to talk with an airport agent, you can simply use this app to get better and quicker assistance. This offers below options:

1. Hotel stay
2. Cab booking integrated with uber
3. lounge stay (max 8 hrs)
4. Book flights of the same or different airlines
5. Need some other option if you have any emergency

In the 5th option, you can connect with flight support services and get a solution to your problem. In this way, if you have any emergency, you can avoid standing in lines and get immediate help from airlines. This is offered because, at the airport, airlines can't increase staff suddenly for all flight attendees.

This offered solution will help make travelers' experience very smooth in the case of such emergencies and you can choose what you want to do without any physical effort.
